# üéØ Correct Tally API Implementation

## You're Absolutely Right!

You need a **specific Form ID** to submit to Tally's API. The API doesn't auto-create forms - it submits to existing ones.

## üìö Based on Tally Developer Documentation

According to https://developers.tally.so/api-reference/introduction:

### Required for Submission:
1. **Form ID** - Specific identifier for your Tally form
2. **API Key** - Your bearer token (we have this: `tly-ue18RtqY67IEAkUNaBC2mylqknxk4ZAk`)
3. **Proper Endpoint** - Correct API endpoint structure
4. **Field Mapping** - Map your form fields to Tally's field structure

## üîß Correct Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create a Tally Form (Manual)
1. **Go to**: https://tally.so/
2. **Create New Form**: "CurationsLA Curator Content Form"
3. **Add Fields**: Match your custom form structure
4. **Get Form ID**: From the URL or API

### Step 2: Get Your Form ID
From your existing forms or new form, you need the Form ID (like `nGryVp`, `m6MZjO`, etc.)

### Step 3: Update API Integration
Replace our current placeholder code with proper Tally API calls:

```javascript
// Correct Tally API submission
const TALLY_FORM_ID = 'YOUR_FORM_ID'; // Need to get this
const TALLY_API_KEY = 'tly-ue18RtqY67IEAkUNaBC2mylqknxk4ZAk';

const response = await fetch(`https://api.tally.so/forms/${TALLY_FORM_ID}/submissions`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${TALLY_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(submissionData)
});
```

## üéØ Two Options to Move Forward

### Option A: Use Existing Form
Looking at your API response, you could use:
- **Form ID**: `nGryVp` ("We'd love to hear about the Good that you are curating for Los Angeles")
- **Already has**: 81 submissions
- **Benefit**: Continuity with existing data

### Option B: Create New Dedicated Form
- **Create**: New form specifically for your custom website form
- **Get**: New Form ID from Tally
- **Map**: Fields exactly to your custom form structure

## üîç Current Analysis

Your API key shows these existing forms with IDs:
- `nGryVp` - "We'd love to hear about the Good..." (81 submissions)
- `3xJGko` - "CuratedLA: Submit Content + Events" (20 submissions)
- `m6MZjO` - "Join: Youth Curator Movement" (2 submissions)

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps Needed

1. **Choose**: Use existing form or create new one
2. **Get**: Specific Form ID for API calls
3. **Map**: Your form fields to Tally's field structure
4. **Test**: API submission with real Form ID
5. **Update**: JavaScript with correct endpoints

## üö® Current Status

**Our current implementation is incomplete** because:
- ‚ùå No specific Form ID configured
- ‚ùå Using placeholder API calls
- ‚ùå Not following Tally's actual API structure
- ‚úÖ API key works (confirmed)
- ‚úÖ Can access existing forms
- ‚úÖ Fallback CSV system still works

## üéØ Recommended Next Action

**Would you like to**:
1. **Use existing form** `nGryVp` (Good curation form with 81 submissions)?
2. **Create new dedicated form** for your website?
3. **Get the Form ID** and I'll update the integration properly?

**You're 100% correct - we need the proper Form ID to make this work!**
