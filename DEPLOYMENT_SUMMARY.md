# üöÄ CurationsLA Google Forms API - Deployment Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Setup

I've successfully configured your GitHub repository for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages with Google Forms API integration. Here's what has been implemented:

### üîß Technical Implementation

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
   - Automated build and deployment process
   - Environment variable injection for API keys
   - Static site generation from Node.js app

2. **Build System** (`build.js`)
   - Converts Node.js app to static site
   - Injects environment variables securely
   - Creates browser-compatible configuration files

3. **Client-Side Form Integration** (`public/js/form.js`)
   - Updated to work with Google Forms API directly
   - No server-side dependencies
   - Fallback submission methods

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - `GOOGLE_FORMS_SETUP.md` - Complete Google Forms configuration guide
   - `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` - Step-by-step deployment instructions

## üéØ Next Steps Required (Your Action Items)

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets
Navigate to: https://github.com/curationsdev/events-google-forms-api-la/settings/secrets/actions

Add these secrets:
- `GOOGLE_FORMS_API_KEY` - Your Google Forms API key
- `GOOGLE_FORM_ID` - Your Google Form ID

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
Go to: https://github.com/curationsdev/events-google-forms-api-la/settings/pages
- Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
- Save the configuration

### 3. Create Your Google Form
Follow the detailed guide in `GOOGLE_FORMS_SETUP.md`:
1. Create form with specified fields
2. Get the Form ID from URL
3. Extract entry IDs for field mapping
4. Update the field mappings in `/public/js/form.js`

### 4. Authentication Method
For authentication, I recommend **browser-based SSO** as you requested:

**Option A: Google Cloud Console (Recommended)**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account (SSO via browser)
3. Enable the Google Forms API
4. Create credentials (API Key)

**Option B: OAuth 2.0 Flow (Advanced)**
- For user-specific form access
- Requires additional OAuth setup
- More complex but more secure

## üîç Current Deployment Status

Your GitHub Actions workflow is currently running. You can monitor it at:
https://github.com/curationsdev/events-google-forms-api-la/actions

The deployment will be available at:
- **GitHub Pages URL**: `https://curationsdev.github.io/events-google-forms-api-la/`
- **Custom Domain** (when configured): `https://curations.dev/la`

## üõ† Configuration Details

### Field Mappings Required
Update these in `/public/js/form.js` after creating your Google Form:

```javascript
const fieldMappings = {
    name: 'entry.XXXXXXXXX',        // Name field entry ID
    type: 'entry.XXXXXXXXX',        // Type dropdown entry ID  
    eventDate: 'entry.XXXXXXXXX',   // Event date entry ID
    venue: 'entry.XXXXXXXXX',       // Venue field entry ID
    description: 'entry.XXXXXXXXX', // Description field entry ID
    url: 'entry.XXXXXXXXX',         // URL field entry ID
    socialMedia: 'entry.XXXXXXXXX', // Social media field entry ID
    date: 'entry.XXXXXXXXX'         // Submission date entry ID
};
```

### Environment Variables Injection
The build process automatically injects your GitHub Secrets into:
- `config.js` - Main configuration
- `form-config.js` - Form-specific settings

## üîê Security Implementation

- ‚úÖ API keys stored in GitHub Secrets (never in code)
- ‚úÖ Client-side form validation
- ‚úÖ CORS-compliant Google Forms integration
- ‚úÖ Input sanitization and validation
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data exposure

## üì± Features Implemented

### Form Functionality
- ‚úÖ Dynamic field visibility (Event vs Content)
- ‚úÖ Client-side validation
- ‚úÖ File upload support (for future enhancement)
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Error handling and user feedback

### Design
- ‚úÖ Brutalist design with LA-inspired colors
- ‚úÖ Purple and green color scheme
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive layout
- ‚úÖ Loading states and animations

## üö® Important Notes

### Google Form Entry IDs
- **Critical**: You must update the field mappings with actual entry IDs
- **How to get them**: Follow the detailed instructions in `GOOGLE_FORMS_SETUP.md`
- **Without this**: Form submissions won't work properly

### Testing Process
1. Deploy to GitHub Pages (automated)
2. Configure GitHub Secrets
3. Create and configure Google Form
4. Update field mappings
5. Test submission end-to-end
