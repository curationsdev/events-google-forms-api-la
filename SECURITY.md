# Security Policy

## Security Summary

This application has been reviewed for security vulnerabilities. Here is the current status:

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ All npm dependencies are up to date and free of known vulnerabilities
- ✅ body-parser updated to v1.20.3 to fix DoS vulnerability
- ✅ Environment variables are properly secured and not committed to repository
- ✅ Form validation implemented on both client and server side
- ✅ CORS configured for security

### Known Considerations

#### Rate Limiting
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: The application currently does not implement rate limiting on form submissions. This could potentially allow denial-of-service attacks through excessive form submissions.

**Recommendation for Production**: Implement rate limiting middleware such as `express-rate-limit`:

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 10, // limit each IP to 10 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/la/submit', limiter);
```

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use GitHub Secrets or your hosting platform's environment variable management
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production

### Input Validation
- All form inputs are validated on the server side
- Client-side validation provides user feedback
- URL validation ensures proper format
- File uploads are restricted by type

### HTTPS
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Configure SSL/TLS certificates properly
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

### API Keys
- Store Google Forms API key in environment variables
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Use service accounts with minimum required permissions
