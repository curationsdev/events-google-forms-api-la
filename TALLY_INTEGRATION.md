4. **Copy the key** (starts with `tly-`)

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/curationsdev/events-google-forms-api-la/settings/secrets/actions
2. **Add secret**: 
   - Name: `TALLY_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your production API key

### 3. Update JavaScript (Production)
Replace the hardcoded dev key with:
```javascript
const TALLY_API_KEY = process.env.TALLY_API_KEY || 'fallback-key';
```

### 4. Test Production Deployment
- Submit test data through your form
- Verify submissions appear in Tally dashboard
- Confirm CSV fallback still works
