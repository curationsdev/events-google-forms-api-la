# üîç Google Form Integration Debug

## Current Issue
The form is submitting but responses aren't appearing in your Google Form because we're using placeholder entry IDs.

## Your Google Form
**Form ID**: `1fVCzIK1NYcajiDCZxiLlFI7hf89-K5WEk4gN1Alvblw`  
**Preview URL**: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fVCzIK1NYcajiDCZxiLlFI7hf89-K5WEk4gN1Alvblw/preview

## Step 1: Get Real Entry IDs

**Quick Method:**
1. Open your form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fVCzIK1NYcajiDCZxiLlFI7hf89-K5WEk4gN1Alvblw/viewform
2. Right-click ‚Üí "View Page Source"
3. Search for `entry.` - you'll find lines like:
   ```html
   <input name="entry.1234567890" ...>
   ```
4. Copy each entry ID

## Step 2: Current Placeholder Mapping (NEEDS UPDATE)

```javascript
// These are FAKE entry IDs - replace with real ones
const fieldMappings = {
    name: 'entry.1234567890',           // Field 1: Name
    curationslaEmail: 'entry.2345678901', // Field 2: Email Used to Subscribe  
    type: 'entry.3456789012',           // Field 3: Submission Type
    submitMedia: 'entry.4567890123',    // Field 4: Submit Media
    eventDates: 'entry.5678901234',     // Field 5: Event Date(s)
    venue: 'entry.6789012345',          // Field 6: Venue Name
    description: 'entry.7890123456',    // Field 7: Description
    url: 'entry.8901234567',            // Field 8: Website URL
    socialMedia: 'entry.9012345678',    // Field 9: Social Media Link
    date: 'entry.0123456789'            // Field 10: Submission Date
};
```

## Alternative: API Integration

If Google Forms entry IDs are difficult to get, we can switch to:

### Option A: Google Sheets API
- Submit directly to your Google Sheets
- More reliable than Forms submission
- Requires Google Sheets API key

### Option B: Simple Fallback
- Email submissions to yourself
- CSV export functionality
- No external dependencies

## Quick Test

To test if the current form submission is working at all, try submitting a test entry and check:
1. Browser Network tab for successful POST
2. Google Form responses tab
3. Any error messages in browser console
